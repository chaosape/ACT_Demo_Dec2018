# ACT_Demo_Dec2018
An AADL model with C behavior files to demonstrate the ACT plugin for OSATE. This demonstration was prepared as part of a Decemeber 10th deliverable for the DARPA CASE program. This demonstration contains one mitigating alteration to deal with an issue that precludes the use of dataports for this demonstratation. Specifically, the mission command being sent between the FlightPlanner and the WaypointManager is not actually sent. Instead the WaypointManager always has the mission command but is waiting for an indication from the FlightPlanner before using it.
